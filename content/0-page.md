Looking for articles, book chapters, conference proceedings, or other research materials? Databases are the best place to search. The library subscribes to over 200 databases, including many discipline-specific options.

This walkthrough provides steps for using **Academic Search Premier**, a multi-disciplinary database, to search for sources related to the sample topic on *why we sometimes get music stuck in our head*.

#### 2. Search for Articles.

- Type keywords **earworms music brain** in the search box. This is the same as using the Boolean phrase **earworms AND music AND brain** because the database automatically puts an AND in all capital letters between each word. 

- Click search after typing the keywords.

#### 3. Find Full-Text Articles.

- Click the HTML, PDF or linked full text icon on the left to view the whole article.

- A “check for full text availability” means the library may or may not have access to the full text online. 

- If the full-text is not available, it can be ordered for free from [Interlibrary Loan](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/){:target="_blank"}. Once you are signed in to your library account, you can click "Request from Interlibrary Loan" to submit your request.
