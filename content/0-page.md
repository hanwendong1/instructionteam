Looking for articles, book chapters, conference proceedings, or other research materials? Databases are the best place to search. The library subscribes to over 200 databases, including many discipline-specific options.

This walkthrough provides steps for using **Academic Search Premier**, a multi-disciplinary database, to search for sources related to the sample topic on *why we sometimes get music stuck in our head*.

#### 2. Search for Articles.

- Type keywords **earworms music brain** in the search box. This is the same as using the Boolean phrase **earworms AND music AND brain** because the database automatically puts an AND in all capital letters between each word. 

- Click search after typing the keywords.

- Refine results by navigating to the "Refine Results" and "Limit To" sections to add filters to the search results. Check the box to narrow down the search to "Peer-Reviewed" journals and choose a specific date range if necessary.
