Looking for articles, book chapters, conference proceedings, or other research materials? Databases are the best place to search. The library subscribes to over 200 databases, including many discipline-specific options.

This walkthrough provides steps for using **Academic Search Premier**, a multi-disciplinary database, to search for sources related to the sample topic on *why we sometimes get music stuck in our head*.

1. From the Library webpage, [lib.uidaho.edu](https://lib.uidaho.edu){:target="_blank"}, click **Academic Search Premier** under the catalog search bar and magnifying glass.

2. Let’s search for articles related to why we sometimes get music stuck in our head. These are often called earworms. We can type keywords **earworms music brain** in the search box. This is the same as using the Boolean phrase **earworms AND music AND brain** because the database automatically puts an AND in all capital letters between each word. Click search after typing the keywords.

3. After searching and seeing the results page, you can scan the article titles to look for relevant articles. If you want to refine your results, you can navigate to the "Refine Results" and "Limit To" sections to add filters to your search results. You can check the box to narrow down your search to "Peer-Reviewed" journals. You can also choose a specific date range.

The icons in the result list help you know what kind of publication the article is from. 
![periodical](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwendong1/instructionteam/main/images/periodical.jpg){ width=50% } In Academic Search Premier, periodical means popular magazine. 

![Academic journal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwendong1/instructionteam/main/images/academicjournal.jpg){ width=50% } Academic journal means a journal that publishes scholarly articles. Often these articles are reviewed by other experts in the field. This is called “peer review.” 

![News](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwendong1/instructionteam/main/images/news.jpg){ width=50% } News means articles that have been published in a newspaper.

4. Clicking the title of an article, such as "The Classification of Involuntary Musical Imagery," brings up more information, including an abstract or summary as well as other possible keywords you could use in your search. In this example, you can see that we found a more professional term for earworms: involuntary musical imagery. You can pull up all the other articles tagged with that term by clicking "involuntary musical imagery."

On the left, you will see several options for getting the full text article. If you see HTML, PDF or linked full text, you can simply click the icon or link to view the whole article.
If you see a “check for full text availability” link, it means the library may or may not have access to the full text online. 

For example, when clicking “check for full text availability” on “Singing in the Brain,” you are taken to our library catalog and can see that the full-text is not available immediately from our library’s resources, but it could be ordered for free from [Interlibrary Loan](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/){:target="_blank"}.

In this next example, when clicking “check for full text availability” on “Catching Earworms on Twitter...,” you can see a link to the full article under “View Online.”

It’s always a good idea to collect more articles than you think you might need. If your search was not successful, you can redo your search by changing your search terms or using limiters. For example, you could search for involuntary memory music to see a new list of results. Searching for articles can be complex, so don't hesitate to contact the Library for additional assistance. Now you are ready to begin searching for articles.
